# Data insights/observations
# 1. Capmulin seems to be very effective at reducing the tumor volume in mouse s185, the mouse analyzed with a line plot under 'Line and Scatter Plots'
# 2. The proportion of mice is nearly 50/50, but skews towards a slightly higher percentage of male.
# 3. The r-value is .276 for the correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight
